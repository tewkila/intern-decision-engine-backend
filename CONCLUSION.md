# Conclusion for TICKET-101: Decision Engine MVP

## Overview
This document reviews the implementation of the MVP scope for the automated loan decision engine as per TICKET-101. The engine evaluates loan applications based on personal codes, adjusting the approved loan amounts based on the applicant's credit background.

## Achievements
- **Dynamic Loan Adjustment**: The engine smartly changes the loan amount based on how good the applicant's credit is.
- **Flexible Loan Duration**: It adapts by changing the loan period if the initially requested time doesn't meet the approval requirements.
- **Effective Error Handling**: The system deals well with different error situations, making sure the application stays stable and dependable.
- **Organized Design Structure**: Splitting functionalities into services, such as age verification and personal code validation, follows good software design principles.

## Recommendations for Improvement

- **Single Responsibility**: further breaking down the `DecisionEngine` to isolate distinct functionalities into standalone services.
- **Method Decomposition**: Simplified complex methods by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable functions. This refactoring enhances code readability and maintainability, making it easier for new developers to understand and modify the codebase.

### Documentation
- **Documentation**: Improve the documentation detailing the decision process and the logic used at various stages of loan evaluation.

### Integration with External Data
- **Real-Time Data Use**: Move from using hardcoded data to integrating with real-time financial data APIs to enhance decision accuracy and relevance.

## Conclusion
The initial version of the decision engine, as described in TICKET-101, demonstrates strong potential. It effectively manages different loan scenarios and adjusts loan periods as needed. By focusing on solid principles and thorough testing, the project can become even more flexible and adaptable for future growth and improvements.

# Conclusion for TICKET-102: Age Restrictions in Decision Engine

### Features and Enhancements
- **Age Validation**: Implemented checks to verify that applicants are within the legally permissible and financially sensible age range for receiving loans.
- **Dynamic User Feedback**: Updated the system to provide immediate and clear feedback to users when a loan application is denied due to age restrictions, enhancing transparency and user experience.

### Technical Strategy
- **Service-Oriented Approach**: Utilized `PersonalCodeService` to reliably extract and calculate age from personal identification codes, ensuring accuracy across the application.
- **Robust Error Management**: Enhanced `DecisionEngine` to gracefully handle age-related validation failures, providing detailed error messages that aid in troubleshooting and user communication.
- **Frontend Integration**: Improved API responses to include specific messages related to age validation failures, facilitating a better frontend user interface that can inform users about the reasons for loan denial.

## Highlights of Robust Implementation
- **Accurate Age Calculation**: Ensured that age calculation from personal codes is precise and reflects real-world data accurately, minimizing errors in eligibility checks.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Focused on robust error handling to ensure that the system remains stable and provides useful feedback under various scenarios, including invalid input or boundary age cases.

## Conclusion
The completion of TICKET-102 has greatly improved the decision engine's capability to make well-informed and legally compliant loan decisions by incorporating age-related criteria. This enhancement ensures that the system can adhere to legal restrictions and evaluate financial risk based on applicant age, thus enhancing the overall sustainability and regulatory compliance of the lending process. Moving forward, further enhancements could involve integrating dynamic data sources to adjust age thresholds in response to changing demographic trends and financial standards.
